<h2>💻 Lab Activities 💻</h2>

<h3>Lab 1: User Input and Basic Output 🎤</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
  <li>
    <b>Item 1: Song Details Collector 🎵</b>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 <b>Description:</b> A program to input and display song details such as the year, genre, album, title, and artist.</li>
      <li>🎯 <b>Learning Objective:</b> Learn how to take user inputs, work with strings, and display output in a formatted way.</li>
      <li>
        🌟 <b>Instructions for Reviewers:</b> 
        Imagine your favorite song. Can you input all its details accurately into the program? Think about edge cases: What happens if you enter a non-numeric year or leave the title blank? Try testing it to see how the program responds!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Item 2: ASCII Comparison of Characters 🔤</b>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 <b>Description:</b> Compare two characters based on their ASCII values and display the greater value.</li>
      <li>🎯 <b>Learning Objective:</b> Understand ASCII values and how to compare characters programmatically.</li>
      <li>
        🌟 <b>Instructions for Reviewers:</b> 
        Have fun experimenting! Type two characters (letters, digits, or even symbols). Before pressing enter, guess which character has the higher ASCII value. Does the program confirm your guess? Try mixing lowercase and uppercase letters to see what happens.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Lab 2: Conditionals and Palindromes 🔄</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
  <li>
    <b>Item 1: Palindrome Checker 🧩</b>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 <b>Description:</b> A program that checks if an integer is a palindrome.</li>
      <li>🎯 <b>Learning Objective:</b> Practice using conditionals, working with strings, and building logical solutions.</li>
      <li>
        🌟 <b>Instructions for Reviewers:</b> 
        Pick a number—any number! Can you tell if it’s a palindrome just by looking at it? Enter it into the program and see if you were right. Now think: What makes a number a palindrome? Use this as a chance to solidify your understanding of the logic.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Item 2: Discount Calculator 💰</b>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 <b>Description:</b> A program that calculates discounts based on the purchase amount.</li>
      <li>🎯 <b>Learning Objective:</b> Understand numeric operations, conditionals, and user interaction in programs.</li>
      <li>
        🌟 <b>Instructions for Reviewers:</b> 
        Imagine you’re shopping, and the cashier tells you there’s a discount for purchases above a certain amount. Try entering different totals—will the program calculate the correct discount for your "purchase"? See if you can find edge cases, like entering a negative amount. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Lab 3: Advanced Logic 🤔</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
  <li>
    <b>Item 1: Roman Numerals to Integers 🏛️</b>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 <b>Description:</b> Convert Roman numerals into their integer equivalents.</li>
      <li>🎯 <b>Learning Objective:</b> Learn to work with dictionaries, loops, and conditional statements.</li>
      <li>
        🌟 <b>Instructions for Reviewers:</b> 
        Do you know your Roman numerals? Type one into the program (e.g., "X", "IV", "MCMXCIV") and check its value. Then, reverse-engineer the logic: Why does "IX" equal 9, but "XI" equals 11? Play around and try to break the program—what happens if you input an invalid numeral like "IIII"?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Item 2: Perfect Number Checker 💎</b>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 <b>Description:</b> Identify whether a number is a perfect number.</li>
      <li>🎯 <b>Learning Objective:</b> Practice loops, modular arithmetic, and logical checks.</li>
      <li>
        🌟 <b>Instructions for Reviewers:</b> 
        Do you know what makes a number "perfect"? Enter numbers like 6, 28, or 12 into the program and observe the results. Try defining a perfect number in your own words and see how well the program aligns with your understanding!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Lab 4: Object-Oriented Programming 🐾</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
  <li>
    <b>Item 1: Capybara Class 🦫</b>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 <b>Description:</b> Create a class to represent capybaras with attributes like name, gender, and age.</li>
      <li>🎯 <b>Learning Objective:</b> Understand the basics of classes and object-oriented programming.</li>
      <li>
        🌟 <b>Instructions for Reviewers:</b> 
        Think of your favorite animal and how you’d describe it using attributes. Run the program to see how different capybaras are modeled. If you could add one more attribute (e.g., "habitat"), how would you implement it?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Item 2: Array Operations 📋</b>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 <b>Description:</b> Work with arrays to input and retrieve elements based on their index.</li>
      <li>🎯 <b>Learning Objective:</b> Learn how arrays work, including indexing and bounds checking.</li>
      <li>
        🌟 <b>Instructions for Reviewers:</b> 
        Imagine you’re organizing a list of numbers. Enter some values and see if you can retrieve them by their index. What happens if you try to access an index that doesn’t exist? Experiment and think about how you’d handle invalid inputs as a programmer.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
